    "- Agent is liquidating or acquiring certain amount of shares $(X)$\n",
    "- Agent seeks max expected total wealth, with 2 penalty terms\n",
    "    - remaining invetories is penalized over a liquidation parameter (like terminal liquidation cost)\n",
    "    - difference with target (VWAP or POV) in trading rate is penalized over a running parameter\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Market model\n",
    "    - Orders are devided into the following parts:\n",
    "        * other people's instantaneous buy order rate $\\mu_t^+$\n",
    "        * other people's instantaneous sell order rate $\\mu_t^-$\n",
    "        * All the $\\mu$s are pre-determined stochastic processes for simplisity(e.g. O-U process with Poisson jump as stochastic drivers)\n",
